9. [Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'.](https://www.javatpoint.com/factorial-program-in-java)
Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) *n. E.g.- <br/>
<pre>
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 
2! = 2 * 1 = 2 
Also, 
1! = 1 
0! = 1
